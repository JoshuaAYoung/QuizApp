This fully responsive quiz app was built during my time in Thinkful's full-stack bootcamp. Despite the app's small size, I pushed myself to learn more by using a JSON-like array to practice handling data in a real-world evironment. And the design and CSS are all from scratch - no templates, no bootstrap.

Instead of having multiple paths, this app using JavaScript generated HTML and jQuery event handlers to re-render the DOM. 

Progress in the app is tracked inside of the data array and when the user is finished, they're given their score along with a rank based on that score.
